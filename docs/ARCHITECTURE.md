## Console Frontend

The console frontend is a static single page application.
Resources from the backend are automatically stored and updated globally in `recoil` `atoms`.
All data is stored in memory.
All calls from the frontend to work with resources should use the resource utility functions. i.e. `createResource()`.
The frontend should use PatternFly components without modifying the look and feel of the controls using CSS.

The frontend has two builds. One for the stand alone version and one for the dynamic plugin version that is dynamically loaded into the OCP Console.

## Console Backend

The console backend uses a service account to `list` and `watch` kubernetes cluster resources.
Resource events are streamed to the console frontend.
RBAC is enforced using the token passed from the console frontend.
All resources are checked for access using `SubjectAccessReview` calls to the cluster.

The console backend proxies the cluster apiserver `/api` and `/apis` apiserver REST routes.
All REST calls use the token passed from the console frontend.
